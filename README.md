### Branches

- **main**: The main branch contains the frontend codebase of the Six Degrees iOS application. Written in SwiftUI and rendered with Metal shaders, this branch houses the intuitive and minimalistic user interface tailored for iOS devices. It also includes the integration of Apple's Ultra Wideband chip for precise proximity awareness between users.

- **backend**: The backend branch hosts the server-side code responsible for managing user data, and facilitating communication between the app and the backend server. Built with ExpressJS and MongoDB Atlas, this branch manages the backend functionalities of the application.

- **ai**: In the ai branch, you'll find the AI-driven insights module of Six Degrees. This component utilizes Google's Gemini-1.5 Pro Model and Puppeteer for web scraping to generate personalized descriptions based on user inputs and aggregate information about users' social networks.
